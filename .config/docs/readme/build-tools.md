### Build Tools

You might notice that we have a lot of extra files considering that this repository basically boils down to a single Dockerfile. These extra files are meant to make team development easier, predictable, and enjoyable. If you have a recent version of [Node.js]({{ repository.project.node }}) installed, you can get started using our build tools by running `npm i` (or by running `bash start.sh` if you do not currently have Node.js installed) in the root of this repository. After that, you can run `task --list` to see a list of the available development features. Alternatively, you can run `task --menu` to view an interactive menu that will guide you through the development process.

*Note:* We use a custom-built version of [go-task/task](https://github.com/go-task/task) so if you already have it installed then you should either replace it with our version or use a different bin name for `task`.
